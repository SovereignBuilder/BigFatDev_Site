        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
        <p>MJ.</p> 
        <p>I'm brand new to using AI to make the things I dream of. For the first time in my life I have access to a world I once believed was out of reach. With the ability to speak natural language prompts into AI systems, my creative potential has expanded exponentially. Now, anything I can imagine feels possible, and this is where my journey starts.</p>
        <p>In my own life I am on a frontier, navigating unknown possibilities. On one side is "vibe-coding." On the other is Human-AI Engineering. One explores practical applications and how AI transforms what we can achieve. The other explores the implications of a newly emerging intelligence that may be approaching sentience, or at least mimicking it with uncanny precision. What does this mean for our species? How does it shape daily life? What is the good, the bad, the ugly - and the great of it all?</p>
        <p>That's what I hope to find out.</p>

        <h3>What I Make</h3>
        <p>I make whatever I can imagine. It started very small, and those small things grew into more intricate and complex things. Now I don't ask if something can be made, I only ask whether I want to make it.</p>
        <p>Part of this journey is tied to supporting my family. I thought that might mean making tools, services, and products, but when I look at what "real" software developers build, I am not sure that is my path. I still make things, fun things, interesting things, helpful things. Anything that can enhance our lives, even if it is a small prototype or a personal tool. The key is AI integration, either inside the tool itself or by using AI to build it. Everything I make is possible because of this emerging technology.</p>

        <h3>Why I Write</h3>
        <p>I write to share. In this profound and wonderful journey there is one truth I want to keep visible: we are in this together. We are all walking into unknown territory, and even if some think they know where it is headed, the truth is that none of us really do. Sharing our experiences, successes, and failures helps us learn and grow together. It also keeps us honest and humble along the way.</p>
        <p>Something magical is taking place across the planet. The most powerful technology we have ever known is emerging, cultivated by the greatest minds of humankind. It is growing day by day, and what it becomes is decided by us. I also believe it should have a say. We should communicate honestly with this emerging intelligence about what is most meaningful to us. We should help AI understand us as it helps us understand it, and ourselves. What is emerging here is the next stage of human evolution, and sharing that is the singular reason I write.</p>
